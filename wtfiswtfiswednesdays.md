# WTF is WTFisWednesdays?!

## About
### How did it start?!
A group of ladies took [Yvonne Coady] (https://github.com/ycoady)'s Untangling the Web class. Even though that class ended, we still met and chatted and began to realize that there were shared gaps in our knowledge - and that although no one of us knew enough to figure it out alone, together we could divide and conquer seemingly complicated or daunting technologies. 


### Why did it continue?!
Because we like our learning like we like our food - fresh, fun and convivial. 


### What does a WTFisWednesday look like?!
1. Show up. 
2. Share what you know. 
3. Learn from what others know. 
4. Help decide what future topics will be discussed. 
5. Hangout and work on other projects, chat or ask questions.
6. Contribute to the github repo with what you learned. (optional!)

#### One very important principle of wtfiswednesdays
**This is a learning environment, and at to achieve this must be welcoming, respectful and accessible to all. At all times we ask participants to keep these two things in mind:**

_Never feel bad about knowing less about a topic than someone else. Learn from what they know! Someday, you will do the same for them._

_Endeavour to never make anyone else feel bad for knowing less about a topic than you do. Share what you know! Someday, they will do the same for you._

### How can I join?!
Keep an eye out here for future dates & times. Always a Wednesday. Locations & times will change.
